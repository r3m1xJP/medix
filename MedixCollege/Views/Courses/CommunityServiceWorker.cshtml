                            The Community Service Worker program at Medix College provides technical training for individuals

                            looking for a rewarding career in the community service field. This program involves a great deal of

                            small group work, practice interviews, and exercises in self-awareness. During the program, students will

                            grow to understand the complexities of contemporary community work practice, the helping process,

                            human development, first aid/CPR and crisis prevention.

                            <br /><br />

                            Students will practice with families and individuals, understand the human health model, and explore

                            research methods. Throughout the course of the Community Service Worker Program, students will gain

                            the knowledge and experience to prepare them for work with clients from a range of age groups, with a

                            variety of social and emotional issues.

                                I'm Nathan and I'm studying the C.S.W. program at Medix College. My wife actually went there,

                                she's actually graduating today from the Lab Tech course and she said it was a great place to go

                                to school, so that's why I'm going. <br /><br />One of my favorite memory of Medix would be would be just

                                every day going to class with my fellow classmates, my teacher, she's fantastic. There's a lot of

                                people of there in our course that we help, or that we're going to be helping, it's a very humbling

                                experience to know that they're out there. <br /><br />The thing I enjoyed most about the campus was that it

                                was easily accessible and easy to get to and it's only got a twenty minute drive for me every day. I

                                see myself in five years being a Community Service Worker or a Social Service Worker in the

                                drug and alcohol field, that I'd like to go into, specializing in that. <br /><br />I have found it easy make friends

                                on campus, everybody that's in my class I'm pretty friendly with right now so I'm really enjoying

                                that. The thing I like best about my instructors is that they're easy to talk to, first and foremost.

                                Easy to talk to, they are open to answer any questions I have. <br /><br />My family feels great about me

                                attending Medix, they're very happy, their very proud of me ­I didn't have a lot of success in high

                                school so this is actually a great step up for me. I would probably tell somebody it's thinking about

                                attending Medix to go, it's a very easy place to go to school. <br /><br />I know school is very daunting for a

                                lot of people, a lot of people didn't do very well when they were in high school but coming from

                                somebody with that experience, it's really easy to go there, the instructors are very helpful, very

                                caring and they just wont let you fail.
