                            The Massage Therapy diploma program at Medix College provides training for individuals looking for a

                            rewarding career working in the healthcare and spa field. The Medix School Massage Therapy Program

                            is approved by the Private Career Colleges Act, 2005 and upon successful completion of the

                            program, students are eligible to write their Licensing Examination. The Licensing Exams lead to

                            Registration with the College of Massage Therapists of Ontario and the right to use the protected titles,

                            “Massage Therapist and Registered Massage Therapist”.

                            <br /><br />

                            Student will learn and develop the manual skills involved in utilizing various techniques involved in

                            therapy.  Students will also be exposed to other types of therapy practiced by other Regulated Health

                            Professionals and will understand differing approaches, philosophies, and methodologies to treatment

                            which increases the likelihood of inter-professional collaboration. Training will cover such tasks as

                            assessing clients by conducting range of motion and muscles tests, proposing treatment plans and

                            administering massage techniques.

                                I chose Medix because one of my close friends was going here,<br /><br />
                                she recommended it, and I tried it out and I only had positive things to say about it!<br /><br />

                                The thing I really liked about the campus, it's smaller<br /><br />
                                compared to [university] campuses. There are so many students there, the congestion... Here the parking is easy, it's accessible...<br /><br />

                                It's a tight unit. Kind of like a small family, it's really nice!<br /><br />

                                I've seen so many people in a lot of pain, and I've already seen the differences I can make. That just puts a smile on my face. It makes me want to do this so much more. <br /><br />

                                I've made a lot of friends since being here. Hopefully they'd say the same about me!<br /><br />

                                I'm sure they will.<br /><br />

                                One of the most positive things I can say about this school is our instructors.<br /><br />

                                I've had many instructors through college and highschool. You can tell these ones actually care about you. They'll do anything to help you out, they're the most polite people I've ever met. They're fantastic....AND they know what they're doing!<br /><br />

                                They actually know what they're doing! [laughs]<br /><br />

                                My family is actually very proud that I'm attending this college. Just because they see it's a big second chance for me. They’re all very proud of me.<br /><br />

                                Medix College really means to me that big second chance that I have.<br /><br />

                                Of all the jobs I've had, those low paying, minimum wage jobs, I was able to get into a career that I know I can make a successful business in, and actually enjoy it.<br /><br />

                                There's not many people I know who go to work and are actually happy.<br /><br />

                                I'm excited when I go to school, and actually upset when I have to leave, and I think that's the most bizarre thing I've ever said in my life! [laughs].
