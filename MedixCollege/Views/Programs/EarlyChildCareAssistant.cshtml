        <p class="contentp">
            The Early Childcare Assistant program at Medix College provides training for individuals looking for a

            rewarding career working in the Early Childhood Assistant field. Early Childhood Assistants (under the

            guidance of the Teacher) provide a safe and nurturing environment for children that encourages their

            social, emotional, physical and intellectual development through designing and implementing a

            developmentally appropriate curriculum according to established guidelines.

            <br /><br />

            The Early Childcare Assistant program was designed to equip childcare workers with valuable

            knowledge, skills and experience for employment as Assistants in day care centres or early learning

            centres. The program was designed to give students an overview of the responsibilities of an early

            childcare assistant and opportunities to perform those duties. It presents foundational skills needed for

            those seeking to move into an Early Childhood Educator program. The Program has been developed and

            accredited by NACC.

            <br /><br />

            There are employment opportunities for graduates of the Early Childcare Assistant program in

            Brantford, Brampton, Burlington, Cambridge, Durham, Guelph, Hamilton, Kitchener, London,

            Mississauga, Markham, Milton, North York, Oakville, Oshawa, Scarborough, Toronto, Waterloo and

            other cities across southern Ontario.

            essential module allows students to exercise the skills learned in class, learn specific applications and

            to further enhance their learning experience in an early child care setting.
