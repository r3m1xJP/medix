<h1 class="contentH1">PROGRAM SUMMARY</h1>

<p class="contentp">
    The Child and Youth Care with Addictions Support Worker program, developed by Eastern College, is

    designed to teach students the necessary practical skills and theory to work with adolescents, children

    and families with challenging needs such as social, emotional, behavioral and mental health concerns.

    Students will identify the importance of collaborating with colleagues within their field including

    educators, medical and social worker professionals, correctional staff and community partners.

    Networking with these professionals will assist them when implementing appropriate

    prevention/intervention strategies that inspire change.

    The Addictions Support modules explore the physical, emotional and social effects of alcohol, drugs and

    gambling, examine the process of addictions assessment and teach effective case management skills.

    Worker Program in Brantford, Brampton, Burlington, Cambridge, Durham, Guelph, Hamilton, Kitchener,
