                The Community Service Worker program at Medix College provides technical training for individuals

                looking for a rewarding career in the community service field. This program involves a great deal of

                small group work, practice interviews, and exercises in self-awareness. During the program, students will

                grow to understand the complexities of contemporary community work practice, the helping process,

                human development, first aid/CPR and crisis prevention.

                <br /><br />

                Students will practice with families and individuals, understand the human health model, and explore

                research methods. Throughout the course of the Community Service Worker Program, students will gain

                the knowledge and experience to prepare them for work with clients from a range of age groups, with a

                variety of social and emotional issues.

                    I'm Nathan and I'm studying the C.S.W. program at Medix College. My wife actually went there,

                    she's actually graduating today from the Lab Tech course and she said it was a great place to go

                    to school, so that's why I'm going. <br /><br />One of my favorite memory of Medix would be would be just

                    every day going to class with my fellow classmates, my teacher, she's fantastic. There's a lot of

                    people of there in our course that we help, or that we're going to be helping, it's a very humbling

                    experience to know that they're out there. <br /><br />The thing I enjoyed most about the campus was that it

                    was easily accessible and easy to get to and it's only got a twenty minute drive for me every day. I

                    see myself in five years being a Community Service Worker or a Social Service Worker in the

                    drug and alcohol field, that I'd like to go into, specializing in that. <br /><br />I have found it easy make friends

                    on campus, everybody that's in my class I'm pretty friendly with right now so I'm really enjoying

                    that. The thing I like best about my instructors is that they're easy to talk to, first and foremost.

                    Easy to talk to, they are open to answer any questions I have. <br/><br/>My family feels great about me

                    attending Medix, they're very happy, their very proud of me ­I didn't have a lot of success in high

                    school so this is actually a great step up for me. I would probably tell somebody it's thinking about

                    attending Medix to go, it's a very easy place to go to school. <br /><br />I know school is very daunting for a

                    lot of people, a lot of people didn't do very well when they were in high school but coming from

                    somebody with that experience, it's really easy to go there, the instructors are very helpful, very

                    caring and they just wont let you fail.

            <p class="contentp">
                Practical skill-building and a practicum component are used to give students a well-rounded

                understanding of the role of the Community Service Worker. During the

                course of this program, students will learn all of the skills and be trained in all the procedures that will

                be required of them in their new careers.

                <br /><br />

                As a mandatory component of our programs, all Medix students are required to complete an off- site

                externship placement. Placements occur at various locations throughout the College's area. This

                essential module allows students to exercise the skills learned in class, learn specific applications

                and to further enhance their learning experience in the selected facilities.

                <br /><br />

                Medix College also provides an employment advantage as we have established relationships with many

                employers in the field. As a result, employers in the field contact us before posting jobs to the general

                public giving current students and graduates of the program an advantage in the hiring process.
