<h1>PROGRAM SUMMARY</h1>

    The Child and Youth Care with Addictions Support Worker program, developed by Eastern College, is

    designed to teach students the necessary practical skills and theory to work with adolescents, children

    and families with challenging needs such as social, emotional, behavioral and mental health concerns.

    Students will identify the importance of collaborating with colleagues within their field including

    educators, medical and social worker professionals, correctional staff and community partners.

    prevention/intervention strategies that inspire change.
