</p>

<ol>
    <li>Provides powerful tools for a targeted job search campaign</li>

    <li>MEDIX Advantage is designed for the job seeker—it is unlike employer-funded job sites</li>

    <li>Consolidates new job postings from thousands of independent local sources</li>

    <li>Delivers access to a much larger number of local job opportunities than any other source</li>

    <li>
        Reduces the number of missed job opportunities—simply impossible for an individual to

        identify and then keep an eye on all the sources monitored by MEDIX Advantage
    </li>

    <li>
        Most job opportunities captured by MEDIX Advantage are not available on any employer-

        sponsored sites
    </li>
</ol>
