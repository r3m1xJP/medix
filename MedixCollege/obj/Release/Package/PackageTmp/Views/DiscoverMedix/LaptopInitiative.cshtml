    Congratulations on your decision to continue your education here, at Medix College!
</p>

<p>
    Modern Technology, particularly in the medical field has become increasingly important.  It has made

    many of our tasks easier, it has allowed us to become more efficient and it has improved

    communication and taken down barriers.
</p>

<p>
    In order to keep our students in tune with technology, Medix College is proud to have implemented a

    laptop initiative.  Computer use, continues to have a growing importance in the workforce, particularly

    in the field of healthcare. By making computers a tool of “everyday” use in our education model, we will

    be enhancing our students’ computer skills and thus their growth in technology.

    Along with laptops, students will be provided with access to an <strong>LMS platform</strong>(Desire 2 Learn) and an <strong>
        E-

        book platform
    </strong> (Vital Source).
